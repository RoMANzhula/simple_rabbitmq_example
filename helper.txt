0. Run Docker Desktop (for Windows)
1. Run rabbitmq from Docker Desktop (Windows) from terminal(root directory):
    docker run -d -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 --name rabbitmq rabbitmq:management
2. Go to browser (to open rabbitmq management) , input localhost:15672
    user: guest
    password: guest
3. Run all services on Intellij IDEA
4. In Postman: post request - http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send/first-queue
    Body -> raw -> write some text(message) - it's for first queue
5. In Postman: post request - http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send/second-queue
    Body -> raw -> write some text(message) - it's for second queue
6. In Postman: post request - http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send/manually?queueName=QueueForFistConsumerTransient

        Use docker-compose
1. Terminal: cd docker
2. Terminal: docker-compose up --build
3. Check all running services, terminal: docker ps
4. If service not work - check errors in the service, terminal: docker logs here_name_service   //for name example - rabbitmq-producer
5. If service is OK but not work - rerun rebbitmq again, terminal: docker-compose restart rabbitmq
6. Stop docker, terminal: docker-compose down

7. Last update docker-compose solves the problem of alternate launch of services (docs: https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/startup-order/)
